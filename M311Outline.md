###Assessment

Two tests and a final, both in class and take home portions

Need a list of core concepts -- and a choice on which ones need to be assessed in class and which ones can be assessed on a take-home portion.

Grades are based on a number of core concepts, a minimum number of presentations, a certain grade on the final exam (and a project for an A? perhaps using SAGE?)

##Core Concepts

###Parametric and Polar Equations (Ch. 9)
Explore different ways of describing functions in the plane.

* Convert a parametric equation into rectangular form
* Construct parametric equations, especially using circles
* Describe motion using the parameter as a time variable
* Find tangent lines (and slopes) for parametric equations
* Graph polar coordinates and polar equations (explore CAS)
* Convert polar equations into rectangular equations
* Convert rectangular equations into polar equations
* Find the arc length of a polar curve
* Find the area surrounded by a polar curve

###Vectors and Three-dimensional Space (Ch. 10)
Introduction to three-dimensional space and describing points and basic structures in space.

* Locate points in space
* Describe vectors in space
* Add/Subtract vectors
* Find magnitude of vectors, and identify unit vectors
* Find the dot product of two vectors
* Find the angle between two vectors
* Find the cross product between two vectors
* Describe lines and planes in space
* Find a vector perpendicular to a plane
* Find the equation for a plane with given properties
* Explore quadric surfaces (CAS)

###Multivariable Functions (Ch. 12)
Functions with domain in space, but range in the reals.

* Recognize the graphs of surfaces given the function
* Match a surface with its level curves (explore CAS)
* Determine when a limit does not exist
* Prove that a limit exists using the squeeze theorem
* Find partial derivatives
* Interpret as slope and as rate of change
* Use the chain rule for a multivariable function

###Directional Derivatives, Gradients (Ch. 13)
Use partial derivatives in applications, for extrema and other purposes.

* Find a directional derivative
* Find the gradient
* Use the gradient to maximize the directional derivative
* Find the tangent plane to a surface

* (Center of Mass; Surface Area)
* Find triple integrals using:
	* Iterated integrals
	* Non-cubic regions
	* Cylindrical coordinates
	* Spherical coordinates
* Change the order of integration in a triple integral

###Vector Functions (Ch. 11)
Introduction to functions with domain in the reals and range in space (or in a plane); planar and space curves.

* Describe a space curve
